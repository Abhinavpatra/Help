# We seek an enemy to blame as an excuse for our own limitations.

For as long as we have existed, we have been in conflict, for most of human history it has been against animals, then against other dynasties, kingdoms, countries and so on..

But in this global generation when you can be in a perpetual state of consumption with no actual creation, we still have an intrinsic internal dialogue, that gives us this idea that we are somehow fighting something or someone, who is actively working against you, and somehow you are fighting the good fight, with a comment, a like, a little extra hour of engagement.

Chads vs incels
men vs women

This envy that we have for other people, who are just simply existing with us is a very beautiful yet a destructive creation that has plagued atleast my generation >5 && <5. 


## I BLAME.

I blame the people around me for my inadequacies.
I blame women for not giving me attention
I blame smarter men for restricting me from getting what I believe i deserve
i blame this and that..
and a hundred more other things that people reading this have said to themselves.

How does that help?
The only battle we have is against our limitations, and what we do about it.
It is only when we identify the internal weakness as the vile thing that it is, that we can actually defeat our true demons, and instead of fighting, holding grudges and projecting our own insecurities. We can see people as economic units with their own interests, weaknesses, strengths, goals and desires. Accordingly we can align ourselves with people who match certain points and interests of our own, for mutual growth and sustainability.
