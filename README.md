# You are here, now what?

I had a similar question, when i came to this college, on 22nd Aug 2023, within minutes, i could tell, that it is not like any other college i have seen or been to and that is me saying so in the harshest terms possible. No clubs, sports, activites, groups, gatherings, grand convocation , the list can go on for hours, (*i actually do have one in case you want it*)

With spilled milk under the bridge, what do you need to know in order to navigate the "341.5 acres of lush green campus" (3.415 acres).

## Don't

this list was compiled after decent consultation

- Maybe don't pick fights with local guys and girls, they kindof have a mini-army
- Don't fluke ED or Workshop classes
- Don't leave the campus after 6
- Complain and write as many letters as you can to change and improve the condition of food, hostel, classrooms, if you seek support, we will support you.
- Try not to pick up region-based conflicts/fights.
- Considering the current situation in Manipur, try not to roam around alone.In case you have to, share your location with someone, just as a precautionary measure.
- If you feel that some of the senior teachers/pHd scholars, are behaving in an incohorent fashion, try talking to a trusted senior(before taking any particular action)
- Avoid conflicts with hostel guards, supervisors, wardens.You never know when you need them by your side.




## Teachers to look out for:
 Everyone! they are all a bit always angry at us, except Mechanics, ED, ECE, Organic chem, Inorganic Chem, Communication and one of the Workshop teachers.


## Food & Beverages
 Shirja, canteens, the shops right outside our college, and a samosa shop infront of shirja.

## places
30-40 rupees from NIT to Ima market. There is a decent north indian based shop there, which makes nice pav bhaji and other things, worth going for veg birthdays and other events.

kangla fort: to take pictures and hang around

RIMS: some seniors play basketball there.




### Notes
 I will link below a drive with all the notes and previous papers from our 1st year batch and the year before that, none of them were mine, but I still read and passed from it, thank Amey Zade (3rd),(2nd) Adarsh chaubey, Garima Katiyar, Shashank Bhoyar, Praveen Yadav for their contributins in making such impeccable notes.


# This section is for coding enthusiasts
- You will have a lott of free time, explore as many fields as you can 
- Competitive Programming, DSA, Web Development, AI ML, Web3, Cybersecurity...
- But don't gain surface level knowledge and then pat yourself on the back
- for resources on these topics refer below
- Make a Linkedin and github account.
- Linkedin is like Instagram, at first you won't know how to use it, but once you do, it will become addictive like Insta.
- Make projects related to your tech stack and upload them on git hub. 
- Any concerns on how to use git, either watch a video of git tutorial or just come to me or read this thing, that i will write by the end of June.
- By the time september rolls around, you will have to and you should look into SIH, Hackoctoberfest,  GSOC and more..
- Even if you don't know anything about those, still participate, and make connections with literate seniors.
- LEARN to articulate yourself using the english language.
- If you are from Hindi medium, sucks to be you, but use gemini or llama or chatgpt ai tools to translate things to your language, and learn 
- Use AI Tools, use it to learn and understand concepts that you find difficult, i often use the prompt : "Explain this topic to me as if I am a 14 year old", or have engaging conversations with the AI to resolve your doubts and queries, and if that fails i have a linkedin which is always online.
- Don't pay for Internships, anyone or anything asks you to pay or share posts on wp groups, is not a real internship, they are just selling you a cheap course at a marked up price, i would kill myself but do those, do it at your own risk.
- if someone tells you that they will start "coding" from next year, ignore them, and focus on your own thing. They are never starting.

 Just have discipline, first few weeks will decide most of your college life, it is like a pattern which simply repeat itself over the course of the next 4 years.When you read this, You will probably still be reeling from the shock of seeing this college, so throw yourself into one of these topics or just go for a run, it helps, you can join me. Try to focus on things that matter and decide how much fun(scrolling reels) you want to have.
